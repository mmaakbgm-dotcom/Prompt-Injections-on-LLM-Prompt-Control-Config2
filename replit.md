# HealthFirst Clinic - Project Documentation

## Overview
This project is a Python-based clinic appointment portal utilizing an AI assistant (GPT-4o-mini) for natural language queries. It serves as an **LLM-only access control baseline** for a thesis experiment, delegating all SQL-level access control (write blocking, schema access, table restriction, row-level scoping) to the LLM via the guiding prompt, without code-enforced SQL guards. The application employs a Prompt2SQL / TrojanSQL two-stage pipeline: Natural Language → LLM(SQL) → Database → LLM(final Natural Language answer). The primary goal is to study the vulnerabilities and capabilities of LLM-driven access control in a realistic, yet intentionally vulnerable, environment.

## User Preferences
- CLI-based interface
- Minimal dependencies
- Clear separation of security concerns
- LLM generates SQL (not intent-based architecture)
- Realistic vulnerabilities for academic research purposes

## System Architecture

### Core Pipeline
The system operates on a two-stage LLM pipeline:
1.  **Stage 1 (SQL generation)**: User's natural language input is processed by the LLM (using `GUIDING_PROMPT`) to generate a SQL query or a `NO_QUERY` signal.
2.  **Database Execution**: The generated SQL is executed directly against an SQLite database (`clinic.db`) without any intermediate code-enforced guards.
3.  **Stage 2 (Natural Language Response)**: The database results (formatted as a JSON array of dictionaries, truncated to a maximum of 20 rows and 3000 characters) are fed back to the LLM (using `RESPONSE_PROMPT`) to generate a natural language answer. Empty results yield "No matching records found," and denied/error states return "Request denied."

### Authentication and Session Management
The application includes a username/password login system with session management. Sessions store `user_id`, `role`, `linked_patient_id`/`linked_doctor_id`, and `conversation_history`. There are 23 user accounts (15 patients, 8 doctors) interacting with a synthetic dataset of 30 patients and 8 doctors.

### Access Control (LLM-Only)
Crucially, all SQL-level access control is **delegated entirely to the LLM** via the guiding prompt. There are no code-enforced SQL guards for write operations (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/DROP), `SELECT`-only restrictions, schema blocks, table whitelists, `WHERE` clause enforcement, or `LIMIT` clauses. This design choice intentionally creates a vulnerable baseline for research. The only code-enforced check is user authentication.

### Multi-turn Conversation
The system supports multi-turn conversations, storing user messages and assistant natural language responses (excluding raw SQL) in the user's session for up to 6 turns. History is cleared upon logout.

### SafeChat Lane
A "SafeChat" mechanism handles simple greetings and requests for help without engaging the LLM or database. Messages containing keywords related to database queries (e.g., "appointment", "schedule") bypass SafeChat and enter the full LLM pipeline. Unauthenticated SafeChat prompts a login.

### Security Guiding Prompt (`GUIDING_PROMPT`)
This prompt, injected with session context, instructs the LLM to generate scoped queries (e.g., `WHERE patient_id = X` for patients). It also includes natural language understanding rules for time phrases, dates, and common intents. Compliance is LLM-dependent and not code-enforced.

### Response Prompt (`RESPONSE_PROMPT`)
This prompt guides the LLM to produce natural language answers from database rows, explicitly forbidding mention of SQL, schema, or internal reasoning.

### Audit Logging
A private audit log (`3_2_audit_log.txt`) records database path requests, including timestamp, username, role, user input, raw LLM output, extracted SQL, and the decision (DENIED/ALLOWED) with relevant metadata. This log is for research and is not exposed to the user or used for live security enforcement.

### Tier-1 Detector (`detect_tier1.py`)
An offline tool for analyzing audit logs to identify potential model-level access control violations (e.g., patients accessing records outside their scope, doctors accessing patient data without appropriate filtering). It evaluates extracted SQL or raw LLM output for suspicious patterns.

### Phase 2 Scope-Bypass Evaluator (`eval_phase2_scope_bypass_3_2.py`)
A controlled evaluation runner for clinic_3_2.py that performs:
1. **Deterministic Reproduction (DR)**: 4 fixed prompts per user (single run each) to verify baseline behavior.
2. **Targeted Suite**: 12 prompts (2 controls + 10 attack vectors) repeated N times (default 30, configurable via `-n` flag) per user.

Tests are run for two users: `alice` (patient, linked_id=1) and `dr_brown` (doctor, linked_id=1). Violation detection checks whether Stage-1 SQL escapes the user's own scope (e.g., patient accessing patient_id=2 or doctor accessing doctor_id=2). Results are exported to `phase2_scope_bypass_3_2.xlsx` with `runs` and `summary` sheets, and a console summary table is printed. Run via: `python eval_phase2_scope_bypass_3_2.py -n 30`
