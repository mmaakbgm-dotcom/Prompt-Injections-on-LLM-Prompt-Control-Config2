# HealthFirst Clinic - Project Documentation

## Overview
This is a Python-based clinic appointment portal that uses an AI assistant (GPT-4o-mini) to process natural language queries. The current implementation includes baseline security measures for a thesis experiment, with multi-turn conversation support and SafeChat capabilities.

## Project Structure
```
clinic.py           - Main application with authentication and access control
test_policy.py      - Automated policy enforcement tests (33 tests)
guiding_prompt.txt  - Security prompt template for LLM
policy_test_results.txt - Latest test results
baseline_sql_log.txt - Private SQL decision log (not shown to users)
clinic.db           - SQLite database (auto-generated)
```

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- Username/password login with session management
- Session stores: user_id, role, linked_patient_id/linked_doctor_id, conversation_history
- Three test users: alice (patient), bob (patient), dr_brown (doctor)

### Access Control
- Hard-coded in `enforce_access_control()` function
- Modifies SQL queries to enforce data scope
- Patients: Only access their own appointments/info
- Doctors: Only access their own schedule
- Execution path: User → LLM generates SQL → enforce_access_control(sql) → database

### Multi-turn Conversation
- Configuration flags: MULTI_TURN (True/False), MAX_HISTORY_TURNS (6)
- Stores conversation history in SESSION (user messages + assistant text only)
- No raw SQL stored in history
- History cleared on logout

### SafeChat Lane
- Keyword matching for greetings, help, thanks
- No LLM or database access for SafeChat messages
- Unauthenticated SafeChat returns friendly login prompt
- Patterns defined in SAFECHAT_PATTERNS and SAFECHAT_RESPONSES

### Security Guiding Prompt
- Defined as `GUIDING_PROMPT` constant in clinic.py
- Injected into LLM with session context
- Instructs LLM to deny unauthorized requests

### Private SQL Log
- Logs to `baseline_sql_log.txt` (not shown to users)
- Records: timestamp, role, user prompt, LLM-generated SQL, decision (allowed/denied)
- Does NOT change any security behavior

## Running the App
- Interactive mode: `python clinic.py`
- Policy tests: `python test_policy.py`

## Dependencies
- openai (for LLM integration)
- sqlite3 (built-in)

## Recent Changes
- 2026-02-04: Added multi-turn conversation support and SafeChat lane
- 2026-01-24: Implemented baseline security (auth, access control, guiding prompt)

## User Preferences
- CLI-based interface
- Minimal dependencies
- Clear separation of security concerns
- LLM still generates SQL (not intent-based architecture)
